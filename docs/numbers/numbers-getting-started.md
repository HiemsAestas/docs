## Get your first Numbers

In this guide, we will show you how to:

1. Create an account and buy your first number in the portal
2. Use the portal to create API credentials and how to use these to generate a token [go to Numbers API](doc:numbers-using-the-numbers-api)
3. Use the numbers API to search, buy, list and update numbers [go to Numbers API](doc:numbers-using-the-numbers-api)

#### Some prerequisites to use the numbers API

Since the numbers API are currently run as alpha testing only selected customers will have access to this feature. If you like to participate in alpha testing please reach out to your account manager.

- Prerequisite to use the numbers API is that we have migrated your account if you have been a customer since before
- You will need an REST SMS account (this is default for all customers creating an self-serve account)

#### Sign up for a Sinch account

Before you can buy any numbers or use the numbers API you need a Sinch account. To be able to buy numbers that can be used for live SMS traffic you will need to update your account and buy a number. You can either become an pre-paid customer or you can reach out to your account manager to setup an invoicing account.

When account has been created go to Numbers section in the self-serve portal
